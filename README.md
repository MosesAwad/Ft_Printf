# Ft_Printf
This 42 project involves recreating the printf function. This project servers as a good excercise and introduction when it comes to the use of variadic functions. The printf function can take
as many arguments as the user desires and so, the design of this function involves satsifying that requirement. The project involves string handling where the variadic arguments are added to the
va_list only after a '%' sign is met in the first string and as long as it is not followed by another '%' sign. The conversion characters that were handled were c, s, p, d, i, u x, and X.
